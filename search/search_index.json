Set-up and basic concepts Publishing metrics Putting a single metric Putting multiple metrics Set-up and basic concepts Please, refer to the user guide to learn about how to get started with the API. Publishing metrics Putting a single metric In Statit, metrics are held inside collections. If you already have a collection to put metrics, carry on. Otherwise, go in the web application and create a new collection (say for instance 'test). You will need to use the editor interface to achieve this. Now that the collection exists, let's add a serie inside. The required parameters for a serie are: id, name and frequency. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"putSerie\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"username/test/new-york\", \"name\": \"New York temperatures\", \"frequency\": \"D\", \"observations\": \"[[\\\"2021-03-07\\\", 10.0], [\\\"2021-03-08\\\", 11.4]]\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\" } } That's it. You have added the username/test/new-york serie to your collection. Congrats. Removing the serie Now, let's remove the serie from the collection. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"deleteSerie\", \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\", } } Next steps You will find the full API reference here","title":"Get started"},{"location":"api/#getting-started-with-the-rest-api","text":"This page will help you get started publishing metrics using the Statit API.
