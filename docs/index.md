# Welcome

Hi, welcome on the **publisher guide**.

This guide will help you publish your first series on Statit. If you are looking for the user guide to access series, it is [here](http://help_en.gostatit.com)

The guide is organised in **three parts**:

* [**Getting started**](gs/index.md) - publish your first series and share them with your collaborators
* [**Working in Excel**](excel/index.md) - publish series straight from Microsoft Excel
* [**Going further**](next/index.md) - a few additional explanations

The guide is still in development. Bear with us as we update the various sections

Do not hesitate to [**reach out**](mailto:help@gostatit.com) if you have any question.

Best ✌️
